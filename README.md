# Image to Ascii Generator Web App

Just started this project, and there is still a lot more to go:) 

## Progress Logs

6/4/21: There is now an input form where users can upload an image that sends a post request to generate the image to ascii and display it to the user. This relatively works but there need to be a checking system that ensures the user uploaded a valid file. I also need to slightly change the ascii generator algorithm because the algorithm will have to act differently for a PNG than a JPG. 

6/3/21: Got flask running and able to display the ascii art of a source image already loaded in the flask app files.
